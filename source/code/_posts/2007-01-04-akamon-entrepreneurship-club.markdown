club of the University of Tokyo, created to foster understanding of
entrepreneurship, promote innovation and imbue leadership qualities among
members.

We hold seminars and organize events about entrepreneurship, providing
opportunities for youths and professionals to exchange their ideas and
experiences.

The membership of AEC is open to both students of the University of Tokyo and
non-students who are interested in entrepreneurship and leadership.
