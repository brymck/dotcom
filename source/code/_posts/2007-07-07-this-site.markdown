Well, it's what you see here. The source is open, mostly so I have something to
reference if I need to ask for help or if I want to check what I'm doing while
away from home.

The site enables me to post both publicly for professional reasons and privately
for staying in touch with folks back home. It also includes my résumé and links
to some code I've done.
