Well, I finally finished up my last CFA exam. I think I did pretty well,
so hopefully I won't need to retake it. For those wondering about the CFA
designation, it's the gold standard for professional certification for
finance. There are three levels of exams required for the charter, and you
can take one test per year, moving from the financial basics to portfolio
construction:

### CFA Topic Weight %

Pass rates are usually pretty bad; for my group it was 35% for Level I, 41% for
Level II, and probably 50% for Level III:

You can crunch the numbers all sorts of ways, but a conservative estimate
for passing all three on your first try in the minimum 2.5--3 years would be
somewhere in the ballpark of 20--25%:

And as the CFA will (hopefully) attest, I'm certified at half-baked
number-crunching. Trust me, I'm a professional. Some other ways to look at it:

* 94,000 people took Level I with me in 2008, and I'd guess 11,000 pass Level
  III this year
* 500,000 people have taken the Level I since 1990, and around 60,000 wound up
  finishing Level III
* Around 20% of the people don't even show up for the exam anyway (this is not
  reflected in the low pass rates).

Bottom line is that I'm glad it's over and hopefully I'll be able to enjoy my
springs going forward instead of staying cooped up inside studying.

So fortunately, a friend of mine from Chapel Hill and the Bay Area is out
here presenting a research paper at various universities. He'll be staying
at my place from Friday through Tuesday, and we were able to get drinks on
Wednesday. So, to answer Leslie's question about having fun alongside all the
work: no, I haven't been, but man, am I going to.

For lack of more interesting items to talk about, then, I guess I'll just
write a bit about grilling here. Contrary to your experience in Japanese
steakhouses—the Japanese term is teppan'yaki—in the US such as Benihana, there's
very little flair to the cooking style. The food is mostly okonomiyaki or
monjayaki, mixes of batter, cabbage, and wide variety of meats and vegetables
that comes out looking like a pancake. Darn good, though.

And then there's the self-service style, like yakiniku, Korean-styled
barbecue. You order cuts of meat and vegetables and grill them on gridirons over
wood charcoal. Here are some shots of cow tongue (seriously, it's really good):

And lastly, there's always the chance to do some good ol' fashioned
Western-style barbecue at a local park, as Maiko and I did a few weeks
ago in Tsurumaki Park, about two hours north of Tokyo by train. There's a
small business here in Japan called [The Meat Guy][meat_guy] that supplies
international meat products, and we wound up getting crocodile and ostrich (and
chicken, beef and lamb). A fellow partier told some children in the park that
the croc was alien meat. Their eyes filled with terror:

So here's to me getting through my professionals, y'all getting through
graduation season, and everything else that we can put behind us as we look
forward to summer. Thanks to everyone for the well wishes, too. I really
appreciated it!
