Well, everyone, we're in the spring holiday season here in Japan. They have
something called [Golden Week][golden_week] where four holidays fall close together:

* Thursday - [Shōwa Day][showa]. It was the Shōwa Emperor's birthday; the West
  knows him as Hirohito. Unlike Presidents' Day in the US, the holiday's not
  a celebration of him but rather time to reflect on the era's difficulties,
  extending from WWII to the height of the Japanese bubble in the 80s.
* Friday - No holiday, but most employers shut down anyway. I have one class.
* Monday - [Constitution Memorial Day][kenpo]. Japan's constitution was
  ratified on May 3, 1947 with strong US input and influence from our own
  Constitution. Like the Fourth of July, it's a chance to reflect on democracy.
* Tuesday - [Greenery Day][midori]
* Wednesday - [Children's Day][kodomo]. They've been celebrating this for over
  1300 years.

So, basically, it translates into a week off. I went to Yokohama on Saturday
with Maiko, which is about half an hour south of Tokyo by train. We got off the
train at Chinatown, a bustling restaurant and retail district near the eastern
ports, with an atmosphere similar to Chinatown's in San Francisco. Maiko got
some jasmine tea she'd been searching for at one of the many tea stores. We
got lunch, then headed over to the city's art museum's exhibition on artifacts
from Pompeii, on loan from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. It's a fascinating
exhibit, mostly because you realize just how materially wealthy these people
were, despite living 2000 years ago. Self-heating marble baths, giant frescos,
and the kind of metalwork and stonework furniture and statues that would fetch a
fortune even if made today.

Today we're just hanging out in Tokyo, and tomorrow I'm meeting up with her mom in Tokyo then we're all (along with Maiko's brother, Shun) heading up to a hot spring in Nikkō. Shun just got a job at a manufacturing company in Nagoya, so we'll be celebrating.
