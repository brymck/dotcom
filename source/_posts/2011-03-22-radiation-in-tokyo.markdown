Hey everyone, I just figured I'd send out a quick note on radiation in
Tokyo. There have been a bunch of units tossed around (sieverts, rads, grays,
curies, roentgens, etc.).

The highest reported dosage per hour for my ward, Bunkyo, is 80 nGy/h (nanograys
per hour), or at worst 60 nGy/h above the average. 10,000,000 nGy equals 1
rad, which means [60 nGy/h is roughly equal to an additional 0.05 rads a
year][rads_a_year] at worst, or spending a month or so in Denver instead of
Tokyo. Of course, that assumes the reactors are never brought under control,
whereas [radiation levels in Tokyo are mostly back to normal][tokyo], which is
still less than the international average.

For comparison, here's a map of the US, where you can see the accumulated dosage
[fallout][fallout] due to extensive nuclear testing in Nevada. Naturally, the
impact on Americans of testing 100 above-ground nuclear weapons (and 900-some
underground ones) far exceeds what a few downwind, more-or-less regionally
contained accidents will have on Tokyo:

In more simplistic terms, that means that even if the worst-case scenario in
Tokyo continued for the rest of my life, it would pale in comparison to what the
US has done to itself intentionally through nuclear testing.

I can understand folks with young kids or health problems leaving, along with
those concerned about supply chain issues and those just wanting a break. And
neither the national government nor TEPCO have done much to inspire confidence,
withholding important information and issuing conflicting statements. But the
US media and public officials have a duty to weigh risks dispassionately, and
they've gone off the other end.

Long story short, your energies are put to much better use watching college
basketball. Really. It's been a good tourney thus far [if you don't live in the
Northeast][overrated].
