One of my friends from college and the Bay Area, came out here recently, so I
got to hang out with him. It was cool to have somebody from the States here, and
him being here also gave me the convenient excuse to hit up a more than a few
eateries in town.

If asked to name one method of preparation that distinguishes Japanese food
from Western food, most people would probably think first of how sushi, sashimi
and the like are served raw. Well, another thing is the popularity of food
that's cooked at your table. In the previous post I mentioned okonomiyaki, which
is cooked by your server on a gridiron in the center of your table. However,
self service is arguably even more popular—all the fun of cooking without the
rinsing, cutting and cleanup. So let's dig in!

First up was hinabe, a descendant of Chinese hot pot. We received a pot with
two broths—one spicy and one mild—in which to grill platters of meat and
vegetables. Nabe, a catch-all term for anything-goes stew cooked in a pot at
your table, is pretty popular at house parties, especially in the winter. We
wound up at the hot pot place because the sushi place we wanted to try out had
a ridiculous line, though. We gave up and decided to walk around until we saw a
place that looked good, which usually works out just fine in Tokyo.

The following night was kushiage. Ever been to a state fair where they'll fry
everything from meat to Snickers to the batter itself? Well, in the same spirit,
kushiage provides you with a smorgasbord of fryable foods to choose from and
grill at your table. They gave us 90 minutes of tabe-hōdai (all-you-can-eat) and
nomi-hōdai (all-you-can-drink). As I'm fond of saying, "it's not an opportunity,
it's a challenge." The safe go with chicken, the daring go with cheese rice cake
donuts.

Then there's shabu-shabu, named after the sound that meat makes when you swish
it through boiling broth (okay, the Japanese aren't great with onomatopoeia). I
went with Todd and his co-workers from the Bay to a place in Ginza—think Fifth
Avenue—where you received two hours' worth of beer, sake, broth, green onions,
pork, sauce and spices, along with side dishes like fish, crab and, of course,
pickled salmon cartilage. Again, we cooked everything at our table, with servers
nudging fresh cuts of pork at us as we progressed.

We also got zarusoba (cold buckwheat noodles served with soy-based dipping
sauce), went to a European-style café, and found an imported beer bar. So all in
all, things worked out pretty well food-wise.

Aside from the food, among the first things my friend wanted to do was ride
the roller coaster (given the intimidating name "Thunder Dolphin") near my
apartment, which I hadn't been on yet. In any case, to get there we had to
walk through the Tokyo Dome complex. There was some Korean pop band called JYJ
playing at the Tokyo Dome that day, and dutifully waiting out the 85° degree
heat with their sun umbrellas was a line of young and middle-aged women about
half a mile long:

They must have been there for hours. I caught a few teary eyes and breathy
sighs when the voice of one of the band members could be heard over the
loudspeaker. The line for the roller coaster, by the way, was about 10‒15
minutes or so.

Of course, when you think about the reaction the Beatles met in America, it's
hard to get too down on domestic female fans. It's not as hard with the male
fans. I also stumbled across the sign below:

It's an advertisement for AKB48, an all-girl pop group, basically 3 groups of
sixteen girls apiece, ages 14 to their mid-20s. You might expect that tweeners
make up the fan base, but in actuality it's mostly male geeks. As some guy
on a news show explained, as the internet replaces TV as the main source of
music acquisition, all-girl band fans have shifted from the likes of [Onyanko
Club][onyanko] (Kitten Club) to [Morning Musume][momusu] (Morning Princess) to
AKB48 ("AKB" refers to [Akiba][akiba], Tokyo's district for geek staples like
electronics, comics and video games). *shudder*

The placard translates (poorly) as "AKB48: 17th Single General Election, I
Swear on My Mom's Name, It's True." About the election bit, on an annual basis,
the fans vote for their favorite girls. The top 48 recipients become that
year's AKB48, and there's this really arcane system for assigning priority
in album vocals, music video appearances, photo shoots and so on based on
rank. Apparently 350,000 extremely creepy votes were cast in the recent
"election." Of course, this is all very serious business. For what it's worth,
here's the music video for one of their hits:

You're a bigger person than me if you can make it through the whole thing.
