So, for what it's worth, I drew a bit on what I've been developing for Excel to
make a quick quote service app for [Google Chrome][chrome]. It also pulls quotes
from Bloomberg, Google and Yahoo!, and then adds some charting capabilities.

We'll see how much time I have to work on it and improve things, but I made it
because there doesn't seem to be a great variety of finance apps that can get
you information on the fixed income, futures and stock markets. So, there you
go, a simple little exercise that puts everything you need (and a lot of things
you don't) a button click away:
