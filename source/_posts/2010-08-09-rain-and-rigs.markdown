So I've done an impressively poor job of keeping everyone back home up-to-date,
and a lot has happened since I last wrote home. Since my last update, Japan has
entered and exited the rain season, my semester has ended, and I've been to a
music festival at the beach just east of here.

### Rain

First off, there's weather. It seems like the East Coast has had awful, hot,
humid weather, but I can tell you that I haven't been spared. The one difference
is in temperature swings. If you were to compare temperatures, you'd think
Charlotte's been a lot like Tokyo. But really, Charlotte (and most places on the
East Coast) cool down a lot at night and really heat up during the day. Tokyo's
just semi-hot and muggy all the time:

It was kind of kept that way by the rain season. The imagery is a little
exaggerated in the West; the rain season is not all rain all the time like
Seattle or something, but more like three or four days a week or so. What is a
bit weird, though, is that when it rains it's still really hot, so you don't go
back inside to fetch a jacket, just the umbrella. Now that the rain's ended,
Tokyo's supposed to get a bit hotter, but that heat is moderated by the lower
humidity.

### Rock

We're now in the midst of summer vacation for much of Japan due to Bon, a time
for family reunions and paying respects to your ancestors. With no work on
Monday, that means the weekend before is a great time for big events. Maiko and
I went to both days of Summer Sonic, a huge Tokyo music festival. The lineup was
pretty solid and included Stevie Wonder, Taylor Swift, Jay-Z and The Smashing
Pumpkins, among the more popular acts. There were six main stages with live
music around the clock. The outside stages were really hot, so the afternoon
sets at the stadium were mercifully kept around forty minutes apiece.

I saw:

* The Maccabees - British indie rock
* Eikichi Yazawa - Japanese classic rocker à la Bruce Springsteen
* Nas - hip hop
* a-ha - synthpop
* The Smashing Pumpkins - alternative rock
* Sakanaction - electronic pop
* Bigelf - Deep Purple/Black Sabbath-ish prog rock
* Coheed & Cambria - progressive rock (with horse doctor's doses of heavy metal
  and hardcore)
* Band of Horses - folky, ambient South Carolina indie rock
* A Tribe Called Quest - old school hip hop
* Taylor Swift - pop country (hey, I said I went with Maiko!)
* Slash - hard/blues rock (you know, the worthwhile member of Guns & Roses)
* Dream Theater - progressive metal (one of my favorite bands and my favorite
  guitarist)
* The Pixies - the forebears of American alternative rock

Yeah, I had to forgo Stevie Wonder (for Dream Theater).

### Miscellania

I also biked across the city (once, to pay for and ride a nice used bike
home) and completed a bunch of administrivia for my grad program (like paying
$200 for an English test to prove that I, an American, can speak English at a
conversational level). But that's really boring.

Hope everyone's been having a great summer!
