So we're nearing the end of the holidays here.

First things first, I've been thinking about how to reach the widest audience
without cluttering people's inboxes. In that spirit, I'll be posting everything
on my [personal website][brymck].

I previously hinted that I'd be hiking Mt. Takao, but those plans fell
through. It's probably for the best, though, as the mountain seemed ridiculously
crowded, and today was Greenery Day. There have been news reports that a cable
car line was an hour long. Now, I didn't plan to take shortcuts (it takes 30
minutes to hike the cable-car route anyway!), but regardless, I already ate a
lunch this week where I waited in line for over an hour. The Japanese tolerance
for (or, rather, love of) queuing up is beyond far mine. In case you were
wondering about that lunch, though, here it is:

_**Outer ring** (clockwise from the top-left corner): ōtoro (the best cut of
tuna), red snapper, tuna, red clam, eggplant, sea urchin, shrimp with mayo, eel,
bonito, salmon and salmon roe, crab. **Inner ring**: two pieces of egg, sweet
shrimp, cuttlefish, shrimp head (decorative, I think), porcelain bowl filled
with shellfish._

Very good stuff, although I could barely finish it all.

Today I'm heading up to Nikkō to hit up a hot springs. It will be my first
overnight stay at one, so I'm looking forward to the experience.
