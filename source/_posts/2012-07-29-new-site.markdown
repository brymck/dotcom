Or, better put, new site engine. The previous site, still visible at
<http://old.brymck.com>, was mostly hand-rolled in PHP. While a useful
experience, it's taught me the difficulties of doing everything yourself. And
the frustrations of a language that
[makes you think about things that you shouldn't have to think about][type_comparison]
and [has a community willing to give the worst advice imagineable][w3schools]:

``` php
<?php
$q=$_GET["q"];

$con = mysql_connect('localhost', 'peter', 'abc123');
if (!$con)
{
    die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
}

mysql_select_db("ajax_demo", $con);

$sql="SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = '".$q."'";
```

This has to be the most basic, most obviously wrong piece of code on the web. If
some hapless webmaster copy-pasta'd this code into his own ajax.php, all you'd
have to do is visit
http://hissite.com/ajax.php?q=[Robert\');%20DROP%20TABLE%20user;\-\-][drop_tables]
and voilÃ , site wrecked. That is, your SQL statement would become:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = 'Robert'; DROP TABLE user;--'
```

That's more time than I need to spend bemoaning what's probably the most popular
web language (on the most popular site explaining it to beginners), and my site
was immune from such basic stupidities in the first place, but it's infuriating
when bad advice is so prevalent. It indicates underlying issues in the quality
of the community: not everyone, but enough that the laziness manifests itself
regularly and makes maintaining the whole thing feel like fixing the house with
duct tape. It might _work_, but that's not the point. The Ruby community, on the
other hand, has at least been tremendously helpful, and that's attractive.

So now I have this site, built using a static blog framework called
[Octopress][octopress], itself based on [Jekyll][jekyll]. It's much easier to
customize without having to dig into the guts of my old, slightly horrible code.
Because it's static rather than generated on-the-fly, anything dynamic has been
outsourced: pages are generated, comments come from [disqus][disqus], etc. I
don't even need a database except for a few stray details, mostly due to
programs I've written that hit the site.

Also, as a curiosity, I have a Ruby on Rails site developed in parallel with
this one at <http://brymck.herokuapp.com/>. Most of the content is identical. In
the long run I'll probably be using the Rails one, but cheap hosting for non-PHP
stuff in general is still not _there_ in my experience.
