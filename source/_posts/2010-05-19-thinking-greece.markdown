So I've been asked to present a bit in an upcoming seminar about current
financial issues. It's a weekly deal with undergrads, with a regular focus on
economic news, so you would think Greece's weekly swings have been presented
_ad nauseum_, but that's not the case. I remember my own college daze, where
"the market" is so ephemeral that you have no idea what's relevant, so I figure
that's the case here. But being young myself, if there's an economic theme for
our lifetime it is the endgame of overindebted _developed_ sovereigns. So I
figure the presentation will wind up being on what structural aspects of the EU
enabled Greece to get where it is today.

Of all the facts in the Greek case, the most telling is that after emerging from
the IMF's imposed "austerity" regime Greece's debt/GDP will go from 130% to
150%. [Ambrose Evans-Pritchard notes][ambrose]:

The article itself is about [a Cornyn (R-TX) amendment to the financial overhaul
bill][cornyn] containing the following language:

> SEC. 68. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO FINANCE BAILOUTS OF FOREIGN
> GOVERNMENTS
> 
> * IN GENERAL.—The President shall direct the United States Executive Director of
>   the International Monetary Fund—
>   * to evaluate any proposed loan to a country by the Fund if the amount of
>     the public debt of the country exceeds the gross domestic product of the
>     country;
>   * to determine whether or not the loan will
>     be repaid and certify that determination to Congress.
> * OPPOSITION TO LOANS UNLIKELY TO BE REPAID.—If the Executive Director
>   determines under subsection (a)(2) that a loan by the International Monetary
>   Fund to a country will not be repaid, the President shall direct the
>   Executive Director to use the voice and vote of the United States to vote in
>   opposition to the proposed loan.

The amendment passed in the Senate 94--0. For the first time in my memory, the
US, China and Japan all have a significant incentive---and have listed their
concerns about the bailout package---to align against Europe, much less work
together on any diplomatic issue.

Perhaps the most shameful aspect of the bailout is that IMF's involvement came
only because the EU was unable to impose even the most limp-wristed conditions
on its own. Let's start five years ago, when [both Germany and France were
violating][violating] EU deficit/GDP rules. They weren't held accountable
then. Which finance minister would take them to task, inviting retribution
should his own nation lapse? During the US crisis, the preoccupation became how
to change the rules, how to give regulatory agencies the discretionary authority
needed to combat bad financial practices. The discussions were never on how the
rules were applied, even after Madoff's $40bn Ponzi scheme in which the SEC had
all the tools needed, including people spelling things out for them, like Harry
Markopoulos. The point of the US anecdote is that rules are irrelevant if they
aren't followed, and structural reform entails making the rules matter. Coming
up with the proper incentives that enable a monetary-but-not-political union may
be impossible, or at least not worth the effort.

Moreover, let's think about the IMF's proper role. The greatest potential for
both economic growth in this world is in emerging markets by mere virtue of
them playing catch-up. By definition, domestic capital is scarce, and those
nations must access foreign credit markets. Due to market forces or (more often)
problems of their own making, developing nations can become unable to repay
their foreign creditors. The IMF's _raison d'être_ is smoothing international
exchange rate fluctuations and sorting out bad economic policies. But Greece is
a $350bn/year economy, not an African nation.

The convenient targets in all of this are nasty things like speculators, hedge
funds and banks. To take the arguments of EU in the order they emerged, the
first "culprit" was Goldman for helping Greece structure deals that helped
it "mask" debt. Well, "mask" as in ["everyone knew about it."][everyone] The
impact of the swaps was a short-term jump up in Greece's debt/GDP. It lowered
deficit/GDP, but only because short-term cash flows were kicked down the
street. No one cared then, and Greece was welcomed into the eurozone with open
arms. See above, when Germany and France were allowed to skirt the rules.

Months later, once Greek CDS spreads really started reaching crisis mode, the
EU began blaming speculators. Sure, the EU dragged its feet for months since
the news first emerged, and the bet was on an increased likelihood of Greece
defaulting, but the price movement were somehow beyond what was justifiable for
a completely insolvent nation. The apparent culpability of speculators enabled
laws have been passed to limit things like compensation that have little to do
with Greece. Another interpretation of the recent German ban on short-selling
is that discussions are occurring in Germany on whether to shift strategies on
Greece (such as pursuing bankruptcy), but we'll see whether that's the case (I
think not).

Some food for thought is below. As I'm using _CIA World Factbook 2009_ figures,
there seems to be some bias in the US number versus IMF and OECD estimates,
but shifting it up 20% doesn't change the overall picture. Note that, although
not shown, most developing countries have debt/GDP levels far below here, and
the BRICs in particular have low levels of debt. Certain countries like France
are on the border, and Japan's profligacy is light years worse than anyone
else. It's bad enough that [the IMF is publicly telling Japan to pursue credible
fiscal adjustment][japan].
