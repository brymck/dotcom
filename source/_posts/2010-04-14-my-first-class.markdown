Hey guys, it's Bryan again!

Well, sorry I haven't followed up recently, but again, I'm still waiting for
that internet access. I should be up and running Friday night y'all's time,
though. I got my computer access today at school, but the Japanese are about 10
years behind on this whole wireless internet deal, so I can't really do much at
school outside of a lab.

I've updated my photos [here][here]. I recently went up to Utsunomiya to visit
Maiko, and we had a hanami (flower viewing) party with her co-workers. Like in
DC, when cherry trees bloom here it's a very beautiful site for a few weeks, so
companies will usually organize pot-luck picnics in a local park. I also have
some shots of the university's central pond, called Sanshirō Pond. It's a pretty
famous location, and despite being surrounded by campus and then the city as a
whole, is a very tranquil area.

I had my first class today. It was on financial institution interest-rate
risk management with derivatives, something similar to what I did in San
Francisco, so it was pretty cool to see it from both the academic and foreign
perspectives. The lecture was about the structure of the financial instruments
and then a discussion of how they fed into the subprime crisis. Much of it I
knew beforehand, but I look forward to going deeper into the material. Also, for
those of you who think people here are more studious, I'll let you know this:
about half the students around me were reading an unrelated book or playing a
video game on their cell phone. And no one raised their hand (as cultural as
anything, but still).

P.S. Aunt Molly, yes I still have the globe, of course! "Take on the world" is
pretty applicable, you know. I kept the globe at my office in SF, and now it's
in my "office" at the university (a study room for research students where I
have a personal desk). Also, the water dial at my apartment only controls the
water temperature and whether the boiler's on or not. Basically, we only turn
the gas on before we use it and turn it off afterward. I do laundry downstairs
at a coin-op.
