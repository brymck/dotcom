It's been two weeks since my last update, but not much has been happening
lately. I've taken some time out to [revamp my site][revamp] a bit---a nicer
layout, a sidebar showing recent comments and pictures, and some content now
has a Japanese version. Mostly, though, I've been studying for the upcoming CFA
exam. Outside of classes, I've just been hitting the books at local coffee shops
and burning the midnight oil at home.

Aunt Pat asked about what kind of housing people have. I've been bad about
getting back on that—and I haven't been inside any interesting houses—but
I'll give it a shot. Generally, people in cities in Japan live in apartments
or condos. Urban areas tend to be dense, so like any American metropolis
like New York or San Francisco, owning an actual house is prohibitively
expensive. Apartments used to be outrageously expensive in Tokyo, too, but
thanks to two decades of persistent deflation that's no longer the case. At the
very least several places on the periphery have rents near interest payments on
a mortgage (30Y mortgage rates are around 2.5%, by the way).

One thing that does stand out a bit is _[washitsu][washitsu]_, traditional
Japanese rooms. Although most rooms aren't too different from their Western
counterparts, a _washitsu_ usually has _[tatami][tatami]_ mat flooring, no
chairs (just pillows for sitting on), and some knee-high tables at most. Most
modern houses have one or two such rooms—cleaning _tatami_ is a pain—and few
apartments have them.

As for the CFA, it's a professional exam. Thus far I've read 18 books of
400--500 pages apiece, sat through and passed two 6-hour exams, and waited a
good long while for this coming exam, hopefully my last. When I was in the
Bay Area all my CFA exams were in San Jose, a good hour or so from where
I lived and worked, and so I had to drive because there's no good public
transportation. This year's SF exam site is a few blocks from where I used
to work. However, here in Tokyo—where I live right downtown—lo and behold,
the Level III exam is again an hour outside of civilization. C'est la vie, I
guess. Maps of SF and Tokyo, respectively, for reference:

So I'm just looking forward to getting that over with. The exam is on June 6th,
a Sunday, so wish me luck.

As for classes, I worked with a Mongolian guy last week on [a presentation
about the US financial reform bill][reform] aimed at undergrads, in addition
to [writing a bit on Greece][greece]. (Fun fact: Mongolians don't have last
names. If they need one for legal reasons they just use their father's name as
a last name. The "Mc" part of my last name means "son of," so I guess that's
similar. And now you know.) The gist of the presentation was to give Japanese
students a chance to learn about how the US is addressing financial regulation
and to elicit some critical opinions. I don't think I succeeded on that last
count, but hey, who's keeping score?
