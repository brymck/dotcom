I got back a few days ago from Nikkō. It was a great experience and, given the
views, this update is pretty photo-heavy. The shrines and temples of Nikkō
are actually a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The main place we visited was
**Tōshō-gū**. It's a shrine built to honor Tokugawa Ieyasu, first shōgun of the
Tokugawa feudal regime (which was the first to unite Japan and lasted from 1603
to 1868). The shrine has a few particular points of interest:

_The Three Wise Monkeys_ - The equivalent of "see no evil, speak no evil, hear
no evil" in Japanese is mizaru, iwazaru, kikazaru. Zaru at the end of a word
can also mean "monkey." So that's why they're monkeys: Japanese wordplay. Eight
scenes depicting the life cycle of the monkey, including that famous one, are
engraved on the stable of the shrine's sacred horses:

_Yōmeimon_ - The gate leading to the main temple grounds is covered in statues of
guardian lions, scenes of people (with apparent Chinese influence), and detailed
lacquer work (higher-resolution picture here):

And then you have the tomb of Tokugawa himself. His remains are held in a bronze
urn, considerably less ostentatious than the rest of the temple:

We pretty much just walked by Rinnō-ji, and the last of UNESCO list is Futarasan
Shrine. We didn't enter the shrine proper, but it has a famous scenic bridge
called Shinkyō:

The rest of what we did up in Nikkō was go to a hot spring resort. It was a
Japanese-style hotel called a ryokan, which entails a few differences versus
Western hotels. First of all, the floors are tatami mats and, at least in the
sleeping and dining areas, no furniture has legs. The chairs have cushions and
back support, but you have to cross your legs or sit _[seiza][seiza]_. When we
first got into our room, there was a low table and some chairs, along with tea
and some finger food. When we went downstairs for dinner, the staff rearranged
our room, laying out our beds and providing garments for bathing (the beds were
then taken away once we went downstairs the next morning for breakfast). The
food was grown locally, and the chef prepared some very good traditional
Japanese food, along with a handful of Western concoctions. Service was very
individually-oriented, and the views were amazing. As for the springs, they're
usually between 100--110° F, so quite hot. You bathe before entering and then
just relax for, well, as long as the heat is relaxing. Oh, here are some pics of
the dinner and breakfast:
