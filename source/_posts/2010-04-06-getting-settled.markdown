Well, finally, I think I've gotten most of the initial setup here done. I've got
my lease agreement signed, turned on all the utilities except internet (probably
won't have that until the 17th), opened a savings account, registered at the
ward office, paid for health insurance, done the initial registration at school,
bought a phone, bought a bed and the basics for my kitchen and bath, etc. It's
been hectic, but Maiko helped a lot.

If you want a map of the area around my house, [click here][map]. You can click
on the colored areas, zoom in and out and pan.

My photo albums will be [stored here][photos]. Bookmark that because I'll keep
it updated. Also, I have my first pictures uploaded already. Most are of my
apartment, but I'm about to head out and take some pictures of the cherry trees
in K≈çrakuen Garden.

I'll try my best to touch base once I can find a good wireless signal. I got
an iPhone, but I can't use Skype over the phone network. And I don't have the
internet connected at my house, either. So, tomorrow I'll try to get registered
at the computer lab at school so I can use the wireless around there, but
obviously there are no guarantees.

P.S. As if Dook needed another reason to be smug. Good thing it's easy for me to
avoid sports news here.
