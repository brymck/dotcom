Yes, Aunt Molly, there are some weird types out here, but I went to
[Akihabara][akiba]. It's basically a place that started with a lot of
electronics stores, and evolved into a geek Mecca that attracts some of the more
socially awkward types. Think like a permanent Star Trek/video game convention
in the US and you get the idea. There are also places with styles that are more
"out there," like Harajuku Bridge, but I don't have any pictures yet. Most
clothing is fairly Western though.

Classes here are pretty intense, but I'm comfortable with a lot of the subject
matter. And to the extent that it's complex, it's obvious from the conversation
around me that the Japanese students are struggling more than I am, anyway.

The internet saga here continues because I can't get a domestic credit card and
so I had to cancel the contract with my intended providers since that was the
only payment method they accepted. Companies look at my 2-year visa, college
student status, and lack of yen-denominated savings (mostly because I'm holding
back on converting because I think the yen will weaken), so I'll just have to
go another route. Fortunately you can pay most bills at Tokyo's ubiquitous
convenience stores (called konbini), so this is the only company I've had an
issue with. I'll most likely just go with the same company that's providing
my cell phone service. (Side note: Unlike in the US, the iPhone carrier here,
SoftBank, has decent customer service and 3G.) But seriously, lame.
