Hey everybody!

Well, I made it into Tokyo just fine. It was a long flight, but the seats
were good and immigration was a breeze. Or maybe I'm just getting used to
this. Hopefully I won't be too jet-lagged tomorrow.

It's overcast and heading into nighttime here, so I'll wait until tomorrow to
take some pictures. In the meantime, I think Maiko and I are going to head out
for a bite to eat.
