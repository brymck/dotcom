Well, it's been a long while since my last update, but I'll keep this one brief.

My mom and her friend Debbi just visited me in Japan, and they left me with a ton of photos to sort
through. After some deliberation and a whole lot of deleting, geotagging and labeling, I uploaded
them all to Flickr as five separate albums of around 100 pictures apiece. Everything I could
recognize has a spot on the world map, and most of the important Japanese you see on signs and such
is translated.

Here's the home page for those five albums:

Whew.
